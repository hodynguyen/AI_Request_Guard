# AI-Request-Guard: Intelligent HTTP/HTTPS Anomaly Detection System

## 1. Introduction
- Modern web applications face various attacks such as **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and DDoS**.
- Traditional security methods rely on **signature-based detection**, making them ineffective against **zero-day attacks**.
- This project leverages **AI and NLP** to detect malicious requests **contextually**, integrates **Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency**, and applies **Unlearning to dynamically update knowledge**.

---

## 2. Objectives
1. **Detect anomalous HTTP/HTTPS requests** (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, DDoS).
2. **Identify unknown attack types (Zero-Day Detection)** using **One-Class Classification & Self-Supervised Learning**.
3. **Utilize Explainable AI (XAI)** to provide reasoning behind blocked requests.
4. **Implement Unlearning** to forget outdated attack patterns and prevent bias.
5. **Seamless integration** with **Nginx, API Gateways, Kubernetes, and SIEM** without impacting system performance.

## 3. System Architecture
### üîπ **Request Processing Flow**
1. **Client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request**.
2. **Nginx + LuaJIT proxy** intercepts and performs initial filtering.
3. **Lua script forwards suspicious requests** to the AI-based FastAPI service.
4. **Deep Learning Model (BERT/LSTM)** classifies requests:
   - ‚úÖ **Legitimate request** ‚Üí Forward to backend.
   - ‚ùå **Anomalous request** ‚Üí Block & log.
5. **Logging & monitoring (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Grafana)** track real-time threat activities.

### üîπ **Deployment Stack**
- **Layer 1: Proxy Filtering** ‚Üí Nginx + LuaJIT.
- **Layer 2: AI-based Classification** ‚Üí FastAPI + Transformer-based model.
- **Layer 3: Logging & Monitoring** ‚Üí Elasticsearch, Kibana, Grafana.
- **Layer 4: Continuous Learning** ‚Üí Unlearning + Active Learning.

## 4. Implementation Details
### üîπ **Step 1: Nginx + LuaJIT Request Filtering**
- Lua script inspects request **headers, body, and IP**.
- Suspicious requests are forwarded to the AI-based API.

### üîπ **Step 2: AI Model Deployment (FastAPI + PyTorch)**
- Transformer-based model (BERT/LSTM) encodes requests.
- **One-Class SVM, Autoencoder, or Isolation Forest** detects novel attack types.

### üîπ **Step 3: Explainable AI (XAI)**
- Uses **SHAP, LIME** to highlight suspicious request elements.
- Provides a **visual dashboard** for administrators.

### üîπ **Step 4: Logging & Monitoring**
- Stores all requests in **Elasticsearch** for real-time analysis.
- **Kibana/Grafana dashboards** visualize threat patterns.

### üîπ **Step 5: Continuous Model Updating with Unlearning**
- **Removes outdated attack signatures** without retraining the entire model.
- **Active Learning**: Flags unclear requests for human validation.
